                    <h1>How DelveHomes Started Off</h1>
                    <p>DelveHomes originally started off as a small company that originally sold sheds and sold apartments to people who needed living spaces. DelveHomes started from there and worked up making new and newer products like an advanced shed that organizes a resident's tools to things like a car that can travel to things faster than normal cars. From there, DelveHomes worked its way up from the start until they have reached the peak and final plato of working for company to company until they contacted and got a once in a lifetime opportunity with the makers of The Machine to be the main housing unit.
